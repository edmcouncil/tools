Additionally, not all tools support rdf:langString, thus its use in the definition of the Text datatype may cause errors, for example in value and some number restrictions. Min 0 cardinality constraints are ignored by reasoners and other processors, so this allows us to say that the possible values for this property are likely either xsd:string or rdf:langString, but does not require it depending on the environment in which the ontology is deployed."
