                "The dates and times ontology defines commonly used temporal concepts that cover those most frequently needed across domains, with a focus on terminology that is used in business applications. It is designed to be mappable to other date and time ontologies and specifications, such as the W3C Time Ontology in OWL (available at https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/), certain temporal elements in BFO 2020 (see https://basic-formal-ontology.org/bfo-2020.html), time concepts defined in schema.org, and the Object Management Group's Date Time Vocabulary (DTV) specification (available at https://www.omg.org/spec/DTV/), without the corresponding overhead or in some cases, issues. The concepts were originally derived from a number of date and time standards including ISO 8601:2004 Representation of Dates and Times. The ontology itself was derived from the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) Financial Dates ontology, with minor revisions to better reflect requirements for mapping to other ontologies."
