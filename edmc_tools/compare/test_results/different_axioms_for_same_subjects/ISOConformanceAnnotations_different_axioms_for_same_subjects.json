Two additional annotations were also included, one to say that while the ontology conforms with the definition in the standard, that definition needs clarification, and a second one to identify elements that have been added as extensions that are needed to fill gaps in the standard. These additions are not necessarily non-conformant but should be considered as additions when the standard is revised. We also changed the names of the individuals to include the class name, ConformanceToISOLevel, as a prefix in the individual name to ensure uniqueness."
