                "The harmonized datatypes ontology provides a semantic model representing the harmonized datatype definitions for exchanging basic concepts that are commonly encountered in healthcare environments in support of information exchange in the healthcare environment. It is derived from and largely conforms with the ISO 21090:2011 Health informatics - Harmonized data types for information interchange specification, which in turn is compliant with and uses the terminology, notations and datatypes defined in ISO/IEC 11404.\n\t\t\n\t\tThe implementation of ISO 21090 included herein is an OWL 2 DL compliant representation of the datatypes defined in the ISO specification. This means that it is not a perfect match for the UML (Unified Modeling Language) representation given in the standard, as there is not a one-to-one alignment between UML and OWL. For details on mapping UML to OWL, please refer to the Object Management Group (OMG) specifications for (1) the Ontology Definition Metamode (ODM), available at https://www.omg.org/spec/ODM/, and (2) MOF to RDF Mapping (MOF2RDF), available at https://www.omg.org/spec/MOF2RDF/. As a consequence, this ontology is an indirectly conforming implementation that provides mappings to the XML Schema Datatypes that are supported in OWL 2 for some ISO 21090 datatypes, and encodes others in a manner that is OWL 2 DL compliant. References to ISO 11179 with respect to the representation of codes and code sets are faithful to the 3rd edition of 11179 as well as to revisions to that standard that are part of emerging work in the ISO JTC 1 SC32 WG2 working group to the degree possible.\n\t\t\n\t\tFor more information on the ontologies on which this ontology depends, please refer to the Object Management Group (OMG) specifications for (1) the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) specification, available at https://www.omg.org/spec/COMMONS/, and (2) the Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC) specification, available at https://www.omg.org/spec/LCC/. Note that certain Commons ontologies referenced herein, including Documents and Quantities and Units, are not part of the Commons Ontology Library 1.0 Specification but are planned for inclusion in the 1.1 revision planned for late 2022 or early 2023."
