The latest OMG specification for LCC is available on the OMG web site as are the ontologies. The versions of the LCC ontologies included herein represent work in progress for an LCC 2.0 specification and have been updated from the LCC 1.2 version to include the Commons Ontology Library. We anticipate these changes will be incorporated into LCC in 2023."
