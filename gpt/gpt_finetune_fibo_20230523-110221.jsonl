Hence there is a secondary market in the Note, that is the piece of paper, which is the asset. If you sell the note, do you cease to be a syndicate member and the holder becomes one instead? No, syndicate membership is specific to the primary, creation of the instrument, in the same way as a bond issue takes place. What we don't know: whether the participation is freely negotiable, or has limited negotiability. What we think is that as a minimum it gives you rights to the interest and principal, but does not bring you into the facility as a whole. there are (separately) structures which allow you to buy ito the syndicate.

Limited by shares means that the company has shareholders, and that the liability of the shareholders to creditors of the company is limited to the capital originally invested, i.e. the nominal value of the shares and any premium paid in return for the issue of the shares by the company. A shareholders personal assets are thereby protected in the event of the company's insolvency, but money invested in the company will be lost. A limited company may be private or public. A private limited companys disclosure requirements are lighter, but for this reason its shares may not be offered to the general public (and therefore cannot be traded on a public stock exchange). This is the major distinguishing feature between a private limited company and a public limited company. Most companies, particularly small companies, are private.

In this form, the Laspeyres index can be written as the sum of base-period revenue shares of the items in the index times their corresponding price relatives. Statistical agency practice has introduced some approximations to the theoretical Laspeyres target due to a number of practical problems with producing the Laspeyres index exactly. For these and other pragmatic reasons, some agencies use alternatives depending on circumstances. See the IMF publication cited for a full explanation of the most commonly used approaches and trade-offs made for determining PPI.\" , \"The standard methodology for a typical PPI is based on a Laspeyres price index with fixed quantities from an earlier base period. The construction of this index can be thought of in terms of selecting a basket of goods and services representative of base-period revenues, valuing this at base-period prices, and then repricing the same basket at current-period prices. The target PPI in this case is defined to be the ratio of these two revenues. Practicing statisticians use this methodology because it has at least three practical advantages. It is easily explained to the public, it can use often expensive and untimely weighting information from the date of the last (or an even earlier) survey or administrative source (rather than requiring sources of data for the current month), and it need not be revised if users accept the Laspeyres premise.\" .\n|||\n"}

These may be specified individually but more commonly the Calculation event is the one scheduled according to this kind of parametric schedule, with the other dates specified as an offset to these. Here we have allowed for each of the related dates to be independently parametrically scheduled. The notional amount step schedule is a separate kind of schedule, with similar terms but without a period length. For calculation schedules (and possibly payments, resets), there is a different end date to the end /start of the period, since events may be specified as being on specific dates - this is where the Roll Convention comes in. This has the same basic concepts as the generic schedule shown as the parent to this. However, where the upper model has Date with various applicable sub types (known i.e. calendar, specified or determined). For example, an ISDA FpML schedule has a Specified Date (via a convention), and then has a date roll rule which is specified for the whole schedule and applies to each of the dates returned by the parametric specification of the schedule. It has: A schedule beginning and end; A set of regular repeating periods: the scheduled event takes place once per period; Optionally one or two stubs (one start and one end); these may be longer than the repeating period, or shorter. The precise parameters used are: Start of the overall Schedule period: Effective Date End of the overall Schedule period: Termination Date Start of first regular period: not specified (assume Effective Date?) Length of each regular period: Frequency (actually a duration) There are generally three ways in which the regular periods of a parametric schedule may be expressed: first plus last first plus period length last plus period length event date plus period length. In FpML, Roll events (the date that something rolls over from the value used in one period to the value used in the next) is defined in a Roll Convention, which may be a day of the month, a day of the week, or some published set of dates, typically the ISDA quarterly dates for these events. This is therefore the date within the regular period (before adjustments) when the event occurs. This is in addition so a date for the start or end of such a period. In general this applies to the Calculation Schedule (i.e. the event is the calculation event) with other dates specified relative to this, however in principle the other related events (payment and reset or refix) are specified relative to this. It is not immediately clear what specification of a date replaces the Roll event convention element when this happens.\" .\n|||\n"}

Applies to securitized pool, insures the lender. Additional note (IBM): there is a further application of this. When a lender takes a loan which is a where the value of the loan is greater than 80% of the value of the property, at that point it is required for the lender to also get a private mortgage insurance, so they are paying separately for the mortgage insurance so that if the borrower defaults above 80% then the mortgage insurance pays the loss. In the Loan Party Insurer (new \\\"Party\\\" type) you have Loan Party Insured Ratio (e.g. the 80% in the example above). These are different situations but the same principle. So this needs to be modeled for both. 30 June: Is this Lender or Borrower? since you have one lender and one borrower in a single loan, but multiple lenders in the case of packaging this up for a security - there are then multiple lenders and multiple borrowers. A similar kind of insurance exists in the one lender one borrower scenario i.e. the mortgage loan itself. There are two concepts here. the MIG thing was for bundling these. the MIG might apply across multiple contracts, but still be a fact about \\\"the\\\" contract?

Investopedia explains Weighted Average Maturity - WAM The measure is calculated by totaling each mortgage value represented by the MBS. The weights of each mortgage is found by dividing the value of each into the total of all. To arrive at the WAM number the weight of each security is multiplied by the time until maturity of each mortgage, and then all the values are added together. For example say an MBS has three mortgages valued at $1,000, $2,000 and $3,000 (a total of $6,000) and mature in one, two and three years respectively. The weights of these are 1/6 (1,000/6,000), 1/3 (2,000/6,000) and 1/2 (3,000/6,000). The WAM is 2 1/3 years (1/6 x 1 year + 1/3 x 2 years + 1/2 x 3 years).

Lender rights are: - expressed in the Contract Consumer protection develops becaues the contract is written by the potential Lender. So the rights are introcued to rectify the imbalance between the two parties. Same goes for insurance. consumer protection laws (governe dby the relevant consumer protection agency. So the lender protexts itself as it writes th contract AND does the things it needs to do to protext itself, but on the approval process, and with later instruments such as insurance.

Mortgage Insurance is an additional means of mitigating the risk, that the lended may have., so if the information assessed is not accurate, or if the borrower's situation changes for the worse. then the risk rating may go down. So the Mortgage Insurance is a further strategy which mitigates any shortfall in the Lender Righrs that you may have - ie someone guarantees. In the US you can also avoid that by having paid a deposit. PIMI: Principal, Interst and Morgage Insurance.

How this works is that you take the inflation rate when the security was issued, and the inflation rate at the present. The difference between these becomes the Factor, e.g. 100% -&gt; 101% gives 1% so for example for a $1000 issue - calculate the principal on which the interest is paid AND the principal from the point of view of how the principal is repaid. Some inflation bonds only do this on interest, some only on interest, but most apply it to the principal and interest. Coupon interest calculated based on the adjusted amount of the bond. so a fixed coupon rate is multiplied by e.g. 1010 in the example above. Variations e.g. Italy - daily published factor published for that bond, whereas other calculate based on underlying index. Typically a CPI or a statistical number generated by the govt. typically a lagging three month index. See UK bonds on this. US and Japanese ones - look at inflation rate 3 months prior. Unlike an Amortizing Security this principal value of the bond is increasing, whereas for and Amortizing, the principal is decreasing. In Canada, these are also referred to as \\\"real return bonds\\\". Further Notes:Additional review with OTPP May 05 2010 indicates that this is part of a classification of bonds where the principal amount itself varies according to some index, a point which was not understood at the original review session.

Arbitrage is there to exploit market inefficiencies. Would there not be some arbitrage exploited in the CDO. The definition here implies cash CDO only. not cler to reviewers what the ditinctio nis and whether these are mutually excluive. On eview is that the arb CDO has cash inflorws different to cash outflows, e.g. 9.5% v 9% with the 50bp taken as fees. So that might be Arb CDO.

The initial outstanding balances on the designated accounts are sold to the trust as are the rights to any new charges on the designated accounts.

However, analytics that refer to this e.g. Yield to Average Life, then this figure is relevant.

This is not only used for Yield calculations though. It is referred to as an analytic figure in its own right. Average Life uses one of a number of standard pre-payment models (for structured finance at least). For MBS, the average life includes some calculations to take account of pre-payments on the underlying mortgages. This takes account of the possibillity of borrowers paying early. This has to be modeled or forecast (not given) as it's a function of market conditions and interest rate. You would not see this in a market data feed. When you model MBS you calculate Average Life as part of the model i.e. you estimate the percentage of prepayment in the next x length of time and factor this into the Average Life. Refers to Weighted Average Time to receipt of future cash flows. For MBS, early payments will shorten the Average Life. For Student Loans, Credit Card, Loan etc, i.e. all Pool Backed (any bond that has securitized debt). Other bonds: Sinking Funds etc., also Early Payment - partial Call for a corporate / regular bond. Early Payment for pass through has the same effect.

Reverse repo is a term used to describe the opposite side of a repo transaction. The party who sells and later repurchases a security is said to perform a repo. The other party - who purchases and later resells the security - is said to perform a reverse repo. While a repo functions like the sale and subsequent repurchase of a security, but the legal reality and the economic effect is that of a secured loan. This is a loan as the original owner retains the rights to the cashflows of the underlying security. Economically, the party purchasing the security makes funds available to the seller and holds the security as collateral. If the repurchased security pays a dividend, coupon or partial redemptions during the repo, the funds are returned to the original owner. The difference between the sale and repurchase prices paid for the security represent interest on the loan. Indeed, repos are quoted as interest rates. A repo always pays interest at maturity, i.e. there are no periodic interest payments.\"@en .\n|||\n"}

They think the stock will have a big move, but they are not sure in which direction. The earnings release is in one month, so the trader decides to buy a chooser option that will expire about three weeks after the earnings release. They believe this should provide enough time for the stock to make a significant move if it is going to make one, and fully digest the earnings release. Therefore, the option they choose will expire in seven to eight weeks. The chooser option allows them to exercise the option as a call if the price of XYZ rises, or as a put if the price falls. At the time of the chooser option purchase, XYZ is trading at $28. The trader chooses an at-the-money strike price of $28 and pays a premium of $2 or $200 for one contract ($2 x 100 shares). The buyer can't exercise the option prior to expiry since it is a European option. At expiry, the trader will determine if they will exercise the option as a call or put. Assume the price of XYZ at the time of expiry is $31. This is higher than the strike price of $28, therefore the trader will exercise the option as a call. Their profit is $1 ($31 - $28 - $2) or $100. If XYZ is trading between $28 and $29.99 the trader will still choose to exercise the option as a call, but they will still be losing money since the profit is not enough to offset their $2 cost. $30 is the breakeven point on the call. If the price of BAC is below $28, the trader will exercise the option as a put. In this case, $26 is the breakeven point ($28 - $2). If the underlying is trading between $28 and $26.01 the trader will lose money since the price didn't fall enough to offset the cost of the option. If the price of BAC falls below $26, say to $24, the trader will make money on the put.

It is September and they agree that the forward start option will activate on January 1 at the money. That means on January 1 the strike price for the option will be the price that stock is trading at on that day. The option will expire in June. The exact strike price is unknown, but the parties do know the strike and underlying's price will be the same at activation. They can look at current six-month options (January to June) and assess volatility to determine a premium for the option. They agree to trade one contract, equivalent to 100 shares of the underlying stock. They decide on a premium of $40, or $4,000 for the contract ($40 x 100 shares). The call buyer agrees to pay the $4,000 now (September), even though the option doesn't activate till January. On January 1, assume the stock price is $400. The strike is set at $400, and an option is now a vanilla option with a June expiry. At the June expiry, assume XYZ is trading at $420. In this case, the option is worth $20 ($420 - $400 strike). If they settle in cash, the buyer receives $2,000, or if they exercise, they receive 100 shares at $400 and can keep them, or sell them at $420 to make $2,000. Notice that this still results in a loss for the buyer, since they paid $4,000 but are only receiving back $2,000. To make money on the call, the price of the underlying needs to move above the strike price plus the premium. Therefore, if the price moves up to $450 by expiration, the option is worth $50 ($450 - $400 strike), and the buyer receives $5,000. That's a net profit of $1,000 over their $4,000 cost. If the underlying is trading below the $400 strike at expiry, the call option expires worthless and the buyer's premium is lost ($4,000 profit to the seller).\"@en , \"For example, the people buying/selling the option could specify that the strike will be at the money (ATM) at activation, or 3% or 5% in the money or out of the money (OTM). Since it is a customized contract, they can negotiate any terms they want.\"@en ; <https://www.omg.org/spec/Commons/AnnotationVocabulary/explanatoryNote> \"Forward start options typically attempt to keep future strike prices at the money or near the money. In this way, the holder will have the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying asset in the future at or near the then-current market price. Knowing where the strike price will be in relation to the underlying's price makes it easier to come up with the premium (cost) of the option, which is also typically determined and paid at the initiation of the contract prior to the activation date. If, at the expiration date, the underlying trades below the strike price of the option (for a call), then it expires worthless. If the underlying is above the strike (for a call), then the holder exercises it and owns the underlying at the strike price. For a put option, if the underlying is below the strike price, the option has value and will be sold or exercised to realize a gain. If the underlying is above the strike price, the option will expire worthless. Typically, as with most options, the holder may sell the option if it is in the money and take the cash instead of exercising the option. Since it is an exotic option, the seller and buyer of the option may also agree to settle the option with cash instead of delivering the underlying. Once a forward start option becomes active (strike price is set), then the option is valued like a vanilla option.\"@en , \"The only unknown for the contract is the strike price. In terms of pricing the contract, the future price of the underlying asset is also unknown. The contract typically stipulates some parameters for where the strike price will be in relation to the underlying asset's price.\"@en .\n|||\n"}

Assume this is the same thing. Review session notes (pre-OTC SMER): [From: Investopedia: Loan Participation Note] Review: 1. Add terms e.g. contractual terms for participation 2. Are there other types of Participation Note which allow for participation in other forms of Asset / Collateral? 3. Can these be traded or not? Definition suggests a bilateral contract. 14 July: The note is documentation. That is, this is evidence for the securirty. An underwriting document (?) is similar. Someone promises to issue the notes for you. This is similar to how debt securities begin life - the underwriter sets the limits on what you will pay fo rthe ssecurity, and of course the amount. Two step orocess of creating the security and then selling it. See Bond / Debt Issuance diagrams and models. (see diagram notes etc. here) Note = tradeability. Indicates that someone has made a commitment at large. Loan Participation Note is either the other end of the loan, or a way of participating in the loan facility. If the latter, it would be a way of documenting the loan facility in a way that you can freely trade it. The alternative (non LPN) would be different. Circles - trading groups - members of the circle. Have to tell the other members of the circle what's going on, and get their permission from the members of that circle before you can assign those rights to someone else. This would mark out the OTC variant of these things. Then: risk participany, who has no original participation, but (later) agrees to take all of your risk off you. So now we have something with a secondary market and something without. Which is which, and what are they called? Which is the one described in FpML (presumably OTC). Generally, if you document your commitment to lend money, then other members of hte syndicate also have a risk in that you might not stump up your obligations. This has implicatiojns for being able to make this a security. This differs from a bond, where there is no intervening credit facility, you just buyt the thing that way you have become the lender. So there remain some doubts about how a participation note works. There is an element of credit embedded against the purchaser of any such note that gave someone membership ofa syndicate. There are also two sets of words in play: - Syndicated Loan - Loan Participation Note. So one of these probably gives you membership of the syndicate, and the other just gives you participation in the loan. It is less likely that there is a secondary market in the note that gives you participationm in a syndicate (because of the credit risk) but in theory at least, it is possible to create an instrument for this. We just don't know if it exists.\"@en .\n|||\n"}
