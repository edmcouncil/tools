It comprises some that call option or put option. It has option type election date some explicit date.,"For example, assume a trader wants to have an option position for the updated XYZ Inc. earnings release. They think the stock will have a big move, but they are not sure in which direction. The earnings release is in one month, so the trader decides to buy a chooser option that will expire about three weeks after the earnings release. They believe this should provide enough time for the stock to make a significant move if it is going to make one, and fully digest the earnings release. Therefore, the option they choose will expire in seven to eight weeks. The chooser option allows them to exercise the option as a call if the price of XYZ rises, or as a put if the price falls. At the time of the chooser option purchase, XYZ is trading at $28. The trader chooses an at-the-money strike price of $28 and pays a premium of $2 or $200 for one contract ($2 x 100 shares). The buyer can't exercise the option prior to expiry since it is a European option. At expiry, the trader will determine if they will exercise the option as a call or put. Assume the price of XYZ at the time of expiry is $31. This is higher than the strike price of $28, therefore the trader will exercise the option as a call. Their profit is $1 ($31 - $28 - $2) or $100. If XYZ is trading between $28 and $29.99 the trader will still choose to exercise the option as a call, but they will still be losing money since the profit is not enough to offset their $2 cost. $30 is the breakeven point on the call. If the price of BAC is below $28, the trader will exercise the option as a put. In this case, $26 is the breakeven point ($28 - $2). If the underlying is trading between $28 and $26.01 the trader will lose money since the price didn't fall enough to offset the cost of the option. If the price of BAC falls below $26, say to $24, the trader will make money on the put. Their profit is $2 ($28 - $24 - $2) or $200. ",,Release

This is an incentive to complete the construction works. Notes from PoC reviews, discussing Maximum Balance concept: In a Construction Loan you agree a maximum amount that you could draw. As you progress with the construction you continue to draw more and more. So you start with the minimum. Example: for purpose of construction of a house you could need to borrow up to 500K and the bank establishes the milestones at which certain amounts are made availalbe and can be drawn. For instance prior to start you might draw 10%, (50K); the next 50K would be available to draw only once the foundations are laid. And so on. Milestones may include ""Frame standing"" (for American-style frame based houses). Each stage requires inspection on behalf of the bank. So you are starting with no more than 10% (in this example) of what is allowable, and could arrive to the full 500K by the end of ths construction but it is not mandated that you arrive to that.

forward start option,Class,Exotic Options Ontology,,"exotic option that is fully specified with respect to a set expiry date, underlying asset and other parameters, purchased and paid for on initiation, but that becomes active at a set activation date with a strike price determined at the time of activation ",Forward start option is a kind of exotic option. It comprises some that call option or put option.,"For example, assume that two parties agree to enter into a call forward start option on XYZ stock. It is September and they agree that the forward start option will activate on January 1 at the money. That means on January 1 the strike price for the option will be the price that stock is trading at on that day. The option will expire in June. The exact strike price is unknown, but the parties do know the strike and underlying's price will be the same at activation. They can look at current six-month options (January to June) and assess volatility to determine a premium for the option. They agree to trade one contract, equivalent to 100 shares of the underlying stock. They decide on a premium of $40, or $4,000 for the contract ($40 x 100 shares). The call buyer agrees to pay the $4,000 now (September), even though the option doesn't activate till January. On January 1, assume the stock price is $400. The strike is set at $400, and an option is now a vanilla option with a June expiry. At the June expiry, assume XYZ is trading at $420. In this case, the option is worth $20 ($420 - $400 strike). If they settle in cash, the buyer receives $2,000, or if they exercise, they receive 100 shares at $400 and can keep them, or sell them at $420 to make $2,000. Notice that this still results in a loss for the buyer, since they paid $4,000 but are only receiving back $2,000. To make money on the call, the price of the underlying needs to move above the strike price plus the premium. Therefore, if the price moves up to $450 by expiration, the option is worth $50 ($450 - $400 strike), and the buyer receives $5,000. That's a net profit of $1,000 over their $4,000 cost. If the underlying is trading below the $400 strike at expiry, the call option expires worthless and the buyer's premium is lost ($4,000 profit to the seller).  For example, the people buying/selling the option could specify that the strike will be at the money (ATM) at activation, or 3% or 5% in the money or out of the money (OTM). Since it is a customized contract, they can negotiate any terms they want. ",,Release

So the Borrower pays towards the MI, esxcept if they have paid a given amount as deposit. there are 2 types of MI: 1. protects the lender in the event of borrower degault 2. Insurance for ""Incapacity to pay the mortage"" (these can be bought off the shelf - can combine health, unemployment etc.). - this is the Borrower mitigating their own risk. Prevents foreclosure. Similar to general sickness etc. Where the lender charges for MI, the cost is passed onto the Borrower. e.g. if there is a % valuation (e.g. 70% in Aus, 80% in US for example) then no insurance is required.

That means that an investor can invest just a fraction of the amount which would be required to buy the actual underlying asset. For example: You invest in a tracker certificate which is based on a stock basket with a value of 10,000 Euros. Because the tracker certificate uses a ratio of 1:100, you only need to pay 100 Euros for the certificate. If the price of the underlying stocks goes up by 10 percent (to 11,000 Euros), the value of the certificate will also go up by 10 percent (to 110 Euros).  Trackers can be used to invest in the performance of multiple stocks, for example. A tracker certificate is a structured instrument that allows the investor to invest in an underlying asset without actually owning the asset. From an investor perspective, tracker certificates work much like investment funds. The tracker follows the price of an underlying asset (one or more stocks, for example). The investor buys a certificate based on the tracker. If the value of the underlying asset goes up, the value of the certificate goes up with it. If the underlying asset loses value, the certificate loses value. ",,Release
