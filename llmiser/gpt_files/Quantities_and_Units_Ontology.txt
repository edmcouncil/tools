Base quantity is defined as quantity kind in a conventionally chosen subset of a given system of quantities, where no subset quantity can be expressed in terms of the others. Base quantity has examples The International System of Quantities (ISQ) comprises these base quantities (with their SI base measurement units): length (meter), mass (kilogram), duration (second), electric current (ampere), thermodynamic temperature (kelvin), amount of substance (mole), and luminous intensity (candela). These base quantities are not mutually comparable. All quantities of any one of these kinds are, however, mutually comparable.. Base quantity is a kind of quantity kind. It is defined in exactly one system of quantities.
Base unit is defined as measurement unit that is defined by a system of units to be the reference measurement unit for a base quantity. Base unit is a kind of measurement unit.
Derived quantity is defined as quantity kind that may be defined as a product of powers of one or more other kinds of quantity. Derived quantity has examples velocity (length/time), mass density (mass/length3). Derived quantity is a kind of quantity kind. It has factor some quantity kind factor. It is derived from some that base quantity or derived quantity.
Derived unit is defined as measurement unit that is defined with respect to one or more base units, such as as a product of powers of one or more other measurement units. Derived unit has examples 1 minute = 60 seconds For example velocity can be specified as the product of length to the power one times time to the power minus one, and subsequently speed can be specified as velocity to the power one.. Derived unit is a kind of measurement unit. It has factor some unit factor. It is derived from some base unit.
Dimensionality is defined as classifier that represents a set of equivalent units of measure. Dimensionality is a kind of classifier. It has factor at least zero quantity kind factor.
Measurement unit is defined as quantity, defined and adopted by convention, with which any other quantity of the same kind can be compared to express the ratio of the two quantities as a number. Measurement unit has examples week, day, hour, minute, second, kilogram, joule, meter. Measurement unit is a kind of quantity. It is defined in some system of units. It specializes at least zero measurement unit.
Quantity is defined as property of a phenomenon, body, or substance, to which a number can be assigned with respect to a reference. Quantity has examples second, kilogram, joule, meter. These are quantities in a general sense, which is what is meant here by quantity.. Quantity is a kind of measure. It has quantity kind some quantity kind.
Quantity kind is defined as classifier for 'quantity' that characterizes quantities as being mutually comparable. Quantity kind is a kind of classifier. It has measurement unit at least zero measurement unit. It specializes at least zero quantity kind.
Quantity kind factor is defined as factor in a product of powers that defines a derived quantity. Quantity kind factor is a kind of classifier. It has exponent exactly one rational. It has quantity kind exactly one quantity kind.
Quantity value is defined as number and measurement unit together giving magnitude of a quantity. Quantity value has synonyms measurement. Quantity value has examples 2 days, 3.5 hours, 150 lb, 45.5 miles. Quantity value is a kind of Thing. It has measurement unit at most one measurement unit. It has numeric value exactly one decimal.
System of quantities is defined as set of quantities together with a set of non-contradictory equations relating those quantities. System of quantities has examples The International System of Quantities (ISQ) is an example of a SystemOfQuantities, defined in ISO 31 and ISO/IEC 80000.. System of quantities is a kind of classification scheme. It comprises at least zero system of quantities. It defines some that base quantity or derived quantity. It uses at least zero system of quantities.
System of units is defined as set of measurement units associated with a system of quantities, together with a set of rules that assign one measurement unit to be the base unit for each base quantity in the system of quantities and a set of rules for the derivation of other units from the base units. System of units has examples The International System of Units (SI) is a system of units.. System of units is a kind of classification scheme. It applies to exactly one system of quantities. It comprises at least zero system of units. It defines some measurement unit. It uses at least zero system of units.
Unit factor is defined as factor in a product of powers that defines a derived unit. Unit factor is a kind of classifier. It has exponent exactly one rational. It has measurement unit exactly one measurement unit.
