The stock price after 30, 60, and 90 days was $21.00, $22.00, and $24.00. The arithmetic average (mean) is (21.00 + 22.00 + 24.00) / 3 = 22.33. The profit is the average minus the strike price 22.33 - 22 = 0.33 or $33.00 per 100 share contract.

Chooser option is defined as exotic option that allows its holder (buyer) to exercise the right to buy (call) or sell (put) specified assets at a fixed price whereby the buyer does not have to decide whether the contract will be a put or a call until an agreed future date, prior to expiration. Chooser option has examples For example, assume a trader wants to have an option position for the updated XYZ Inc. earnings release. They think the stock will have a big move, but they are not sure in which direction. The earnings release is in one month, so the trader decides to buy a chooser option that will expire about three weeks after the earnings release. They believe this should provide enough time for the stock to make a significant move if it is going to make one, and fully digest the earnings release. Therefore, the option they choose will expire in seven to eight weeks. The chooser option allows them to exercise the option as a call if the price of XYZ rises, or as a put if the price falls. At the time of the chooser option purchase, XYZ is trading at $28. The trader chooses an at-the-money strike price of $28 and pays a premium of $2 or $200 for one contract ($2 x 100 shares). The buyer can't exercise the option prior to expiry since it is a European option. At expiry, the trader will determine if they will exercise the option as a call or put. Assume the price of XYZ at the time of expiry is $31. This is higher than the strike price of $28, therefore the trader will exercise the option as a call. Their profit is $1 ($31 - $28 - $2) or $100. If XYZ is trading between $28 and $29.99 the trader will still choose to exercise the option as a call, but they will still be losing money since the profit is not enough to offset their $2 cost. $30 is the breakeven point on the call. If the price of BAC is below $28, the trader will exercise the option as a put. In this case, $26 is the breakeven point ($28 - $2). If the underlying is trading between $28 and $26.01 the trader will lose money since the price didn't fall enough to offset the cost of the option. If the price of BAC falls below $26, say to $24, the trader will make money on the put. Their profit is $2 ($28 - $24 - $2) or $200.. Chooser option is a kind of exotic option.

Forward start option is defined as exotic option that is fully specified with respect to a set expiry date, underlying asset and other parameters, purchased and paid for on initiation, but that becomes active at a set activation date with a strike price determined at the time of activation. Forward start option has examples For example, assume that two parties agree to enter into a call forward start option on XYZ stock. It is September and they agree that the forward start option will activate on January 1 at the money. That means on January 1 the strike price for the option will be the price that stock is trading at on that day. The option will expire in June. The exact strike price is unknown, but the parties do know the strike and underlying's price will be the same at activation. They can look at current six-month options (January to June) and assess volatility to determine a premium for the option. They agree to trade one contract, equivalent to 100 shares of the underlying stock. They decide on a premium of $40, or $4,000 for the contract ($40 x 100 shares). The call buyer agrees to pay the $4,000 now (September), even though the option doesn't activate till January. On January 1, assume the stock price is $400. The strike is set at $400, and an option is now a vanilla option with a June expiry. At the June expiry, assume XYZ is trading at $420. In this case, the option is worth $20 ($420 - $400 strike). If they settle in cash, the buyer receives $2,000, or if they exercise, they receive 100 shares at $400 and can keep them, or sell them at $420 to make $2,000. Notice that this still results in a loss for the buyer, since they paid $4,000 but are only receiving back $2,000. To make money on the call, the price of the underlying needs to move above the strike price plus the premium. Therefore, if the price moves up to $450 by expiration, the option is worth $50 ($450 - $400 strike), and the buyer receives $5,000. That's a net profit of $1,000 over their $4,000 cost. If the underlying is trading below the $400 strike at expiry, the call option expires worthless and the buyer's premium is lost ($4,000 profit to the seller).  For example, the people buying/selling the option could specify that the strike will be at the money (ATM) at activation, or 3% or 5% in the money or out of the money (OTM). Since it is a customized contract, they can negotiate any terms they want.. Forward start option is a kind of exotic option. It comprises some that call option or put option.

The underlying security is trading at $110, and the option expires in three months.

Thereafter, the holder of the option has the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price of $100, even though it is trading below $90. It is this right that gives the option value. The put option remains active until the expiration date, even if the underlying security rebounds back above $90. However, if the underlying asset does not fall below the barrier price during the life of the contract, the down-and-in option expires worthless. Just because the barrier is reached does not assure a profit on the trade since the underlying would need to stay below $100 (after triggering the barrier) in order for the option to have value..

If we consider a 2 asset "best of plus cash", the payoff at expiry is a choice between Asset 1, Asset 2, or the predetermined cash amount. There is no strike price and the payoff is given as: Rainbow = max(S1, S2, Cash;T)  An asset maximum or minimum payout rainbow is similar to the best of n assets plus cash, with the exception that no cash payoff is possible and there is a strike price for this type of option.

The payoff for minimum of 2 asset rainbow calls and puts are given as: Rainbow-Call = max[0, mainS1, S2) - X] Rainbow-Put = max[0, X - min(S1, S2)]  Better of n Assets This type of rainbow is similar to the best of n assets plus cash but with the exception that there is no possible cash payoff, and X is set to 0. With this in mind, a better of 2 assets rainbow is essentially a two-asset call option, with a payoff being: Rainbow = max[0, max(S1, S2)] Worse of n Assets Essentially the opposite to the better of n assets, with the payoff being on the asset with the lower value. We can give the payoff for this option on 2 assets as: Rainbow = max[0, min(S1, S2)]. Rainbow option is a kind of exotic option. It has underlier some mixed basket.
