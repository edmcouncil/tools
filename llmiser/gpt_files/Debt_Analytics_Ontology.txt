Further notes: A measure of the change in price for a given change in Modified Duration. This always (necessarily) refers to Modified Duration. This is used as another risk measurement. Numerator is always (a) duration - either MacCaulays or Modified. Always rate of change of (one of the) Duration against some other parameter. The other paramater can be characterised as a Yield (it may be the Price, but that has a relationship to the Yield in any case). REVIEW: Inconsistency in the above - is it always necessarily Modified Duration that is referred to, or "any" Duration measure (Macaulays and.or Modified)? notes 9 Dec A measure of the sensitivity of the price with reference to interest rates. This is normally determined with reference to maturity, but since there are different maturity dates, this figure gives an estimate of the equitvalent if you had a homogenous portfolio, i.e. this is an estimate based on a pure equivalent, homogenous portfolio. Convexity of instrument versus portfolio. Sees instrument in terms of the set of cashflows. The term Convexity can be applied either to a bond or to a portfolio.
